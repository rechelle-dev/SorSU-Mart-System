# SorSU Mart System

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.
To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

• System Title : 
  SorSU Mart System

• Description : 
  The SorSU Mart System is a dedicated e-commerce platform designed to serve as a digital marketplace for products created and managed by students in a university's BS Entrepreneurship program. The system provides a organized environment that nurtures campus student innovation and provides a direct path to market for their ventures, while offering the wider campus community and general public a convenient way to support student innovation.

• List of Features Implemented

Complete Shopping Flow: Shoppers can browse products, view details, add items to a cart and wishlist, and complete their purchases through a full checkout process with order confirmation.

Product & Category Pages: Products are organized into categories. The system features dynamic pages for viewing all products, filtering by category, and viewing individual product details.

User Profiles: All users have a profile page where they can view their information. Shoppers can also access their order history.

Public Storefront: Each seller has a public profile page (/sellers/[id]) that showcases their store information and lists all their approved products.

User Management: Admins can view a list of all users in the system (shoppers, sellers, admins) and have the ability to create new user accounts with specific roles.

Database Seeding: A utility page (/seed) was created to instantly populate the database with sample products for demonstration and testing.
